 is the input, 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{w}=\begin{pmatrix}w_{0}\\
w_{1}\\

\end_inset

 is the weight vector and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\phi}=\begin{pmatrix}\phi_{0}\\
\phi_{1}\\
\vdots\\
\phi_{M-1}
\end{pmatrix}$
\end_inset

 denotes a set of basic functions where 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{0}(x)=1$
\end_inset

.
 We can then write
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y(\bar{x},\bar{w})=\bar{w}^{T}\bar{\phi}(\bar{x})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What we now need to do is to choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\phi}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{w}$
\end_inset

.
 As we are using a linear regression model 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\phi}(\bar{x})$
\end_inset

 is simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{x}$
\end_inset

, therefore what is left is to determine 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{w}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What we want to do is to minimize the expression 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{n=1}^{N}(y(\bar{x}_{n},\bar{w})-t_{n})^{2}$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $y(\bar{x},\bar{w})=\bar{w}^{T}\bar{\phi}(\bar{x})$
\end_inset

 which results in the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{w}=(\Phi^{T}\Phi)^{-1}\Phi^{T}\bar{t}$
\end_inset

, where
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Phi=\begin{pmatrix}\phi_{0}(x_{1}) & \phi_{1}(x_{1}) & \ldots & \phi_{M-1}(x_{1})\\
\phi_{0}(x_{2}) & \phi_{1}(x_{2}) & \ldots & \phi_{M-1}(x_{2})\\
\vdots &  &  & \vdots\\
\phi_{0}(x_{N}) & \phi_{1}(x_{N}) & \ldots & \phi_{M-1}(x_{N})
\end{pmatrix}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That means that if we have a basic function 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(x)$
\end_inset

 we can calculate the weight vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{w}$
\end_inset

.
 As we are trying to create a linear model we use the very simple linear
 basic function 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(x)=x$
\end_inset

, that means that our 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi$
\end_inset

 looks like the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Phi=\begin{pmatrix}1 & x_{1} & \ldots & x_{1}\\
1 & x_{2} & \ldots & x_{2}\\
\vdots &  &  & \vdots\\
1 & x_{N} & \ldots & x_{N}

 do, and have done, is write a function 
\emph on

 that computes the weight vector, the function is very simple as itis just

\begin_inset Formula $\bar{w}=(\Phi^{T}\Phi)^{-1}\Phi^{T}\bar{t}$

Why do we use machine learning for such a task? Well we are able to extract
 a lot of information from the different kind of images taken of the space
 objects, al though when they get further and further away, it becomes very
 difficult to distinguish between the objects when looking at simple features.
 Instead we can use machine learning, and especially classification, to
 try and find patterns in the data and a suitable space where the data is
 linear separable

There are several hyperparameters one could delve into to although we will

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 hyperparameters
\begin_inset Note Note

what are those values?
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 It can be hard to find hyperparameters to a given model, especially when
 the range of possible good hyperparameters and the number of parameters
 increases, as it simply gets very computationally expensive.
 I will proceed to determine some initial values for 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 then use grid search and cross validation to try and determine good values
 for the two hyperparameters.

As the assignment text so lightly hints at I will use 
\emph on

.
 As the assignment text is very clear on how to compute the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{Jaakkola}$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{Jaakkola}$
\end_inset

 values, I will refer to my code 
\emph on

 if the reader is interested in how I coded the heuristic.
 With no further due my computed values are:

My initial

Now after using the above initial

 The very high accuracy of the training data does bother and concern me

 again the accuracy of the test data is also very very high, and somehow
 soothes my nerves, although if the test data is very close in space to
 the training data, then the accuracy of the test data is not as soothing
 and my classifier

 might be a victim of overfitting, but it is hard to tell without any more

 It might be that a more optimal combination of hyperparameters would be

\begin_layout Standard
Now we will try to use principal component analysis (PCA) on the galaxy
 training data from the 
\emph on
SGTrain2014.dt
\emph default
 training set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PCA is what? -> One way to describe PCA is to say that it is a way to try
 and find the meaning of the madness.
 A little more technically description is to say that PCA transforms the
 data in such a way that the greatest variance lie on the first axis and
 the second on the second axis and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PCA uses the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the data to transform (rotate
 and move) the data so that the greatest/most important eigenvector is aligned
 with the first axis of the coordinate system, and that the 
\emph on
n
\emph default
'th greatest/most important eigenvector is aligned with the 
\emph on
n
\emph default
'th axis, hence the PCA can project the data in dimensions equal to or lower
 than the input dimension.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why would one want to use it? -> As hinted above PCA can be a very good
 tool to extract the most important features of some dataset, to get rid
 of some noise parameters or visualize some high dimensional data, in a
 humanly perceptually way.
 Which is exactly what we want to do in this exercise for the given galaxy
 data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
Hence PCA can only be performed once one a given data set, as doing it multiply
 times will not result in any new changes as the data is already 'perfectly'
 aligned with the axis.

Question 8 (overfitting)

\begin_layout Standard
John Langford, who is “Doctor of Learning at Microsoft Research”, maintains
 a very interesting blog (web log).
 Read the very true blog entry: “Clever methods of overfitting,” http://hunch.net
/?p=22, 2005.
 Choose three of the different types of overfitting and discuss if and how
 they can occur when applying machine learning techniques to the variable
 star classification task.
 Ignore the last type of overfitting and issues related to reviewing of
 scientific papers (still, it is good to keep them in mind).

Traditional overfitting

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* Too few data points, too complex data (requires complex predictor).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
-> Considering that there is so few data points but so many features and
 classes, one might be concerned of traditional overfitting as there simply
 might not be enough data points to create a generally well performing classifie
r.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This affects the classification in such a way that it has trouble finding
 general meaning of the data and needs to learn the training data more by
 heart to be able to get reasonable results in the training accuracy.
 Which is all we have, the training data, so it is the only set of data
 that we can use to decide wether or not our solution is good enough, and
 hence we strive to get a good result before stopping, but a good result
 (say 90% acc.) might be way to late, but we wouldn't notice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If one wants to maintain the complex classifier then one ought to get more
 training data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Parameter tweak overfitting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* Having many hyperparameters in the classifier and picking those that give
 the highest training accuracy/lowest training error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
-> Does not affect my q7 must, but is a valid factor and easy to talk about.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
-> This has not been such a big concern when fitting my classifiers in question
 7.
 Yet it is still a very big concern in machine learning in general, as once
 you move away from simple classifier such as KNN which only have a very
 few and conceptually simple hyperparameters, and move on to more advanced
 and complex classifiers, or regression models for that matter, you tend
 to get an increase in the number of hyperparameters, and tweaking these
 just right, without a tendency towards overfitting is very hard.
 When dealing with many hyperparameters it is often hard to distinguish
 between their meaning when comparing their values with the results of the
 build classifier and hence also hard to figure hard when the chosen values
 favor the training data too much, hence overfitting.

\begin_layout Standard
-> This will quickly result in overfitting for many of the reasons described
 above in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "sub:Traditional-overfitting"

\end_inset

.
 Seeing that we don't have many training points and it is somewhat hard
 to get very good results with the created classifiers, one might be very
 tempted to focus on the training error and try to maximize this (if considered
 both the given training and test data to be one component) and therefore
 possible overfit the classifier.
 One of the golden rules we have learned in the StatML course is that going
 for 0 empirical risk

 is not the way to go.
 It is very easy to get 
\begin_inset Formula $100\%$
\end_inset

 accuracy/
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 error on the training data, just use 1-nearest neighbor and you are (almost)
 guaranteed a perfect score on your training data.
 Then you have learned your training data by heart, and at the same time
 overfitted your classifier.
